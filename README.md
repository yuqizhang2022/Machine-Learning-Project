# Machine Learning Project

In this project, I used machine learning models to predict Current Option Value and compare our predicted values with values derived from Black-Scholes formula. The prediction accuracy on test data set was more than 94% with the selected machine learning model (extreme gradient boosting). 

**Steps in the project:**
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  2. Feature engineering (created 15 new variables using 4 given variables)
  3. Feature selection (forward stepwise selection)
  4. Model exploration (9 models including random forest, elastic net, NN, SVM, KNN, ...)
  5. Model selection (metrics: out-of-sample R squared for regression and accuracy for classification)
  6. Limitations and future steps to improve the model
